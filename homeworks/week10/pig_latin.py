import os

def main():
    # get the text from the file
    prejudice = get_text('prejudice.txt')
    # prove to ourselves that it worked
    print(word_list)


# get the text from the specified file
# you do not need to change this function
# (but if you want to, you can)
def get_text(filename):
    the_text = ""
    # is the file actually there?

        the_text = file_handler.read()

    return the_text


# the incantation to make the program go
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
