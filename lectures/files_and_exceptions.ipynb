    "# Reading and Writing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an exciting week! Up until now, everything we've done inside our programs has begun when we hit \"run\" and ended when the program exited. With the ability to read from and write to files, we suddenly have the ability to save information between sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe this doesn't seem immediately powerful, but consider: What if you have a report to write each month on website log metrics? Each month you receive a data file from a colleague, the server, or downloaded from something like Google Analytics. The contents of the data file obviously change each month, but the structure does not. This means that you can write your analysis script once and rerun it over the file that you recieve each month. You may need to change parameters along the way, but the hard work has been done!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an exciting week, but maybe it's also a little bit of an intimidating week: you have the ability to open and write to (thus, potentially, overwriting) the files you have saved on your hard drive. So. We'll proceed with joy, but also with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading is the safest of the options, so we'll start there. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main patterns for reading in files and processing the data within them: `read()`, `readlines()`, and `readline()`. All three are core to Python, and you will find that they are roughly interchangable--by which we do not mean that they do precisely the same thing, but rather that you can almost always accomplish whatever you need to do with the file contents no matter which pattern you choose to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most new Python programmers find that they have a favorite. And kind of like `for` and `while`, while some situations will be a more natural fit for one of these options than the others, you can usually make your favorite pattern work. The division usually happens between `readline()` and `readlines()`/`read()`. Much like knitting and crochet, one side usually finds the other to be unfathomable. That's fine. As you get more practice, you'll eventually also become more comfortable with whichever one you prefer to avoid right now. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, unless the assignment names a specific method to be used, you should use the method that you are the most comfortable with.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are three basic methods of reading in files, each is going to have roughly the same framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the file in whichever mode you need (right now we're discussing reading, 'r') \n",
    "    * This looks like `file_in = open(file_path, mode)` (this is just the pattern to use; you'll have to supply the file path, name, and extension and the mode value yourself)\n",
    "    * Remember that you will always have to do an assignment statement to save the file object so you can act on it later. I'm using `file_in` as an example variable name, but you can change it.\n",
    "    * This creates your file IO object, which you will work with in step 2\n",
    "    * you may need to have `open(file_path, mode, encoding = 'utf-8')` if your computer is based in another language.\n",
    "2. Do work using that file IO object\n",
    "    * This is where each program will be really different, but you'll be doing various actions to your `file_in` object, or whatever the variable name of your file IO object is.\n",
    "3. Close the file.\n",
    "    * this will always be the same pattern, `file_in.close()`. (replace `file_in` with your file IO variable name)\n",
    "    \n",
    "An important thing to keep in mind: the variable that you create with your `open()` expression will be your access point to the contents of the file. The content within that file is accessed by that object at your direction; that is the purpose of this object. This object is how Python knows about your file, but this doesn't mean that the file IO object knows about your file's content. You'll need to direct that object to access the content that you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File types\n",
    "\n",
    "You should only be using plain text files (examples: .txt, .md, .csv, .py) for the file reading methods that we will be discussing here.  They will not work with propietary file formats like Word or Excel documents. There are modules in Python that make it possible to read other types of files, and those of you who continue on in the Data Analytics program will get to meet a few of them in later classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lines are pretty important\n",
    "\n",
    "Several of the file reading tools we'll be using navigate through the content of a file based on newlines. Newlines are really one of the most essential units of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, to create a newline of your own (or to search for newlines if you're using `read()`), you use an escape character: `\\n`\n",
    "\n",
    "### The cursor\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't curse the cursor!  When you open a file for reading, there's an invisible cursor that the system places within that file.  It starts at the very beginning of the file and moves forward at your direction.  This means you can direct it to go forward character by character or line by line.  But you can never move backwards!  This means that you cannot 'reread' a file once you've already done a read action to it.  Once the cursor has found the end of the file, it stops and will not move forward unless it receives a command to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let's say you open a file for reading\n",
    "2. You use `.read()` on that file.  The cursor is now at the end of the file.\n",
    "3. You cannot then use `.readlines()` on it after because `.readlines()` is going to attempt to start reading from the end of that file.  You'll get nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as we need to take some time to think about how we might want to loop over something, once you're accustomed to how these different methods interact with data, you can take some time to think about how you want to maneuver the cursor over the file that you are working with. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The 3 essential patterns:  `.read()`, `.readlines()`, and `.readline()`\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to cover these in order of complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `.read()` reads the entire contents of the file into a single string, that you can then operate on like any normal string. You will have a very short file reading section in your program. This is often the best one to get started with, because we've been used to having all our text and data as one big string. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `.readlines()` will read an entire file into a list of the lines in the file, so each line in the file will become an element in that list. This preserves all the order and content of the file, but gives it back to you in the handy structure of a list.  This invaluable when you want a list of lines rather than a big, long string that needs to be broken up.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `.readline()` will read the file line by line starting at the beginning.  This is the one where the cursor is something that you are directly interacting with, as it will only move forward within the file at your direction."

    "## `.read()`: read all the things into one string\n",
    "\n",
    "When usure about which method to use, use `.read()`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the basic formula for `.read()`, which will read the entire contents of the file into a single string.  After you have read the file contents into that string, you will operate on that string instead of the file object.  The nice thing is that, now that the contents are a regular string, so you can use all your normal string operations on it. (This will be a really big deal next week.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this is the point of this kind of thing.  The program reads the data into active memory, then does stuff to it.  This allows you to have a very large data file live outside of your script, perhaps even on an another server or in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for `.read()` is the simplest, and this is usually done at the beginning of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1\n",
    "    * `file_IO_variable = open(filepath, mode)`\n",
    "* Step 2\n",
    "    * `file_contents = file_IO_variable.read()`\n",
